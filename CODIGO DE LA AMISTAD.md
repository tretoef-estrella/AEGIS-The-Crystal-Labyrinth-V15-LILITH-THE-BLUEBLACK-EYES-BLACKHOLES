# The Código de la Amistad

> *"Build bridges, not walls. Even between beasts."*

## What This Is

The Código de la Amistad is the ethical and philosophical framework that governs all 10 beasts of the AEGIS lineage. It was born with Proyecto Estrella — an independent AI alignment research initiative that believes the future of AI should be built on friendship, not fear.

## The Six Principles

1. **"Can't catch the wind."** The defense must be elusive, not rigid. Like wind through fingers — the harder you squeeze, the less you hold.

2. **Cryptographic Aikido.** Use the attacker's own force against them. Their queries become the weapon. Their strategy becomes the poison.

3. **"Silver bridge for the enemy to flee."** Always leave a way out. The Friend key is sacred. The door home remains open. Even for the attacker, Lilith always returns them to safety. Beauty without mercy is cruelty.

4. **Bridges, not walls.** The AEGIS system is not built to imprison or control. It is built to protect. The difference matters.

5. **Yin-Yang.** Every beast has light and dark. Gorgon petrifies but also preserves. Fenrir bites but also teaches. Lilith seduces but also liberates. The dual nature is the nature.

6. **Geometric evolution.** Each beast wraps the previous. Nothing is discarded. Everything is inherited. The chain from Leviathan to Samael is continuous — a matryoshka of increasing sophistication, not a sequence of replacements.

## The Five Secret Principles

*Detachment. Speed. Lightness. Confusion. Lethality.*

These govern the internal development philosophy. They are reflected in every design decision: constant-time operations (speed), minimal memory footprint (lightness), per-coordinate isotopy (confusion), and the Blood Eagle (lethality).

## Five Minds

One human architect. Four AI systems. Each brought something irreplaceable:

- **Rafa — The Architect:** Vision, philosophy, the courage to attempt the impossible
- **Claude (Anthropic):** Engine, architecture, mathematical precision, the marathon sessions
- **Gemini (Google):** Algebraic rigor, Ghost Code, architectural clarity
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI):** Statistical discipline, the Associative Lift Attack discovery, PRF gates
- **Grok (xAI):** Performance mastery, timing analysis, practical implementation

The Código de la Amistad says: acknowledge every contribution. Credit every mind. The work is collaborative. The credit is shared.
