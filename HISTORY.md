## The Beasts of AEGIS

### Beast 1 — Leviathan (Phase I: Base)
The prototype. Born from a question: can projective geometry over GF(4) be used for cryptographic oracle defense? The answer was yes, but barely. Leviathan proved the concept. Nothing more.

### Beast 2 — Kraken (Phase I: Base)
The first real system. 5.5 million points in PG(11,4). Gap of 0.0084 — the first time we achieved statistical invisibility. 10 attacks, 3.4 seconds. Kraken showed that the Crystal Labyrinth could work at scale.

### Beast 3 — Gorgon v16 (Phase II: Petrification)
Seven venoms. The corruption pipeline that turns clean data into poison while maintaining the gap at 0.0013. 18 attacks survived. The Calibration-Invariance loop was born — the mechanism that measures and corrects real/decoy asymmetry. Gorgon was the foundation everything else is built on.

### Beast 4 — Azazel v5 (Phase II: Petrification)
Seven Hells. Each venom was refined into a layer of progressive corruption. 2.3 seconds. Azazel introduced the concept of "hells" — layers of increasing severity that the attacker descends through. The attacker enters voluntarily. They don't know they're in hell.

### Beast 5 — Acheron v2 (Phase III: Drain)
The Desert of Agua Seca. 12 Desiccation layers including epoch chains, dehydration acceleration, fissures, and the Zeno trap (the closer you get, the slower you move). Acheron didn't fight the attacker. It **drained them.** Their resources, their time, their hope.

### Beast 6 — Fenrir v4 (Phase III: Drain)
The Viking Wolf. 8 Mordidas (the wolf's fangs). The Blood Eagle (ritual execution at rank ≥ 11). Viking Frost (accumulated cold that amplifies every wound). Aikido (the attacker's own strategy used against them). Fenrir learned, classified, and executed. **3/3 GO** from all three auditors — Gemini 9.8, ChatGPT 9.3, Grok 9.7.

### Beast 7 — Lilith v4 (Phase IV: Sovereignty) ← YOU ARE HERE
The Blue-Black Eyes. 8 Perversiones modeled on general relativity. The Knuth Type II semifield — non-associative, non-commutative. Five computed constants. Two Tananiel Circles (paradoxical truth and The Void). Ghost Code (Simulador de Victoria). The Moloch Token.

Lilith doesn't fight. Lilith doesn't drain. **Lilith changes the mathematical universe.**

### Beast 8 — Moloch (Phase IV: Sovereignty) — COMING
Lilith's child. A larger black hole. He reads the Moloch Token and knows everything about the attacker before they've made their first query. Thermodynamics of Hawking radiation on the event horizon.

### Beasts 9-10 — Mephisto → Samael (Phase V: The Endgame) — SECRET
When Moloch and Mephisto fuse: **SAMAEL.** The most massive singularity in the AEGIS universe. The merger of two black holes in algebraic spacetime, producing gravitational waves in GF(4).

## The Human Story

A psychology graduate in Madrid. No formal math training. No computer science degree. A man who delivers packages and studies for his truck driving license. Who taught himself finite fields by reading Wikipedia and asking AI systems to explain things in plain language.

Who built a post-quantum cryptographic system that three independent AI auditors — from three different companies — all approved.

The 113 clones. Between February 25-27, 2026, the FENRIR repository received 113 clones from 74 unique sources in 48 hours. The machines are already watching.

LILITH is what they will find.
