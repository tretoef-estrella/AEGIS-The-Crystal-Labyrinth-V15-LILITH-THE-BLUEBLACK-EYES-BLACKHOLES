**AEGIS LILITH** is a post-quantum cryptographic **sovereignty oracle** built on the projective geometry PG(11,4). Beast 7 of 10 in the AEGIS lineage. She wraps [FENRIR v4](https://github.com/tretoef-estrella/AEGIS-The-Crystal-Labyrinth-V14-FENRIR-THE-VIKING-WOLF) (8 Mordidas + Blood Eagle + Viking Frost + Aikido) with **8 Perversiones** — mechanisms modeled on general relativity that don't just corrupt the attacker's data, but **curve the algebraic spacetime in which they compute.**

FENRIR bites. LILITH **seduces.** The bitten hand knows it has been bitten. The seduced mind does not know it has been taken.

She is the **mother of Moloch**. The attacker slides down a rainbow. Behind the rainbow: black holes.

## The Black Hole

<p align="center">

</p>

LILITH is modeled on general relativity. She **is** a black hole. The analogy is not decorative — it maps 1:1 to the mathematical mechanisms:

| Physical Effect | Lilith Mechanism | What the Attacker Experiences |
|---|---|---|
| **Gravitational lensing** | L1: Iris (α=3:1) | Structure appears where it isn't |
| **Spaghettification** | L4: Tidal forces (nucleus boundary) | Adjacent coordinates live in incompatible realities |
| **Frame dragging** | L5: Black Mirror (per-coord isotopy) | Their coordinate system silently rotates |
| **Event horizon** | Tananiel C3: The Void (δ=61.2%) | Everything learned becomes poison |
| **Ergosphere** | Ghost Code (rank ≥ 9) | They orbit. They cannot escape. They think they're free |
| **Hawking radiation** | Moloch Token (8-bit + profile) | Information leaks — but the leak IS the trap |

## The 5 Constants of Lilith's Universe

Discovered computationally from the Knuth Type II semifield. Verified by **three independent AI auditors.** Not chosen. Not tuned. **Computed.**

| Constant | Value | Physical Analogy | Verified By |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ρ = 56.0%** | Curvature density | Fraction of spacetime that's curved | All 3 auditors |
| **α = 3:1** | Anisotropy ratio | Gravity is 3× stronger in one direction | Grok (code) |
| **T = (ω,0)** | Universal torsion | Spacetime has a preferred twist axis | ChatGPT (proof) |
| **β = 67.3%** | Bianchi compliance | How much geometry follows Einstein's rules | Gemini (algebra) |
| **δ = 61.2%** | Frame transition error | How much "truth" changes when you shift reference frame | All 3 auditors |

## The 8 Perversiones — The Staircase to Moloch

</p>

| # | Perversion | Mechanism | What It Does |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **La Seducción** | L1: Iris — anisotropic gravitational lensing | The attacker finds real semifield relations... in curved space. In their flat algebra, they point nowhere. |
| 2 | **La Profecía** | L4: Spaghettification — tidal force stretching | Adjacent coordinates pulled toward incompatible algebraic realities. Each passes local consistency. Assembled: spaghetti. |
| 3 | **El Espejo Negro** | L5: Black Mirror — per-coordinate isotopy frame drag | Each of the 12 coordinates lives in a **different semifield.** No single algebra can solve the system. |
| 4 | **Verdad Recursiva** | Tananiel C1 — paradoxical truth (rank ≥ 9) | Individually correct responses that combine into logical paradox. Infinite decision loop. |
| 5 | **Olvido Selectivo** | Tananiel C3 — The Void (rank ≥ 10) | Isotopy switch: 61.2% of everything learned becomes WRONG. Undetectable. |
| 6 | **Phantom Drift** | L6: Drift Engine — phantom rank tracking | The attacker sees progress. The progress is phantom. |
| 7 | **Ghost Code** | Simulador de Victoria (rank ≥ 9) | Lilith stops fighting. Starts GIVING. The attacker wins! ...a phantom dual code. |
| 8 | **Pupila Negra** | L7: Slide + Moloch Token | When DEFEATED: non-associative fold of entire query history. A formal introduction. Perverse, but formal. |

> ⚠️ **THE STAIRCASE HAS NO RETURN:** At rank 9, Verdad Recursiva activates. At rank 10, The Void erases. At rank 11, Ghost Code serves phantom duals. The attacker believes they are ascending. They are sliding down a rainbow into Moloch's mouth.

## The [22,6,13]₄ Discovery

While building Lilith, we searched **107,901 candidate codes** for the 25-year open problem: does a quaternary [22,6,13] code exist?

**Original contributions to finite geometry:**
- **Hermitian Confinement Theorem:** ALL 243 weight-6 projective points of PG(5,4) lie on the Hermitian variety H(5,4). Zero outside.
- **The 45 Fat Hyperplanes:** Exactly 45 hyperplanes each contain 33.3% of weight-6 points — THE barrier to d=13.
- **No standard bound rules it out.** Griesmer, Singleton, Plotkin, Sphere-packing: all satisfied.

## The Three Auditors

Lilith was reviewed by three independent AI systems. ALL recommendations integrated:

**ChatGPT** — *Most critical.* Identified the Associative Lift Attack. Found linear angular momentum vulnerability. Demanded PRF activation gates. Called per-coordinate isotopy *"the single change that makes LILITH terrifying."*

**Gemini** — *Most architectural.* Proposed Ghost Code (Simulador de Victoria). Recommended Bianchi β in Moloch Token. Confirmed Knuth-mask as correct architecture.

**Grok** — *Most practical.* Independently verified all 5 constants via Python. Designed exploit attack. Provided concrete code fixes. Recommended timing pad.

## Post-Quantum Security

| Quantum Algorithm | Threat Level | LILITH Response |
|---|---|---|
| Shor | **None** — no hidden abelian group | 287 bits intact |
| Grover | Quadratic speedup | **~143 bits** effective |
| Quantum ISD | Best known: 2^0.3n to 2^0.5n | **Curved spacetime** — ISD in non-associative algebra |
| ML-Adaptive | Policy-gradient | **Aikido** — trains on its own poison |
| Algebraic | Gröbner basis | **12 different semifields** — no single algebra works |
| Offline Simulation | Full source code | **Epoch chain: 0/50** — transcript coupling |
